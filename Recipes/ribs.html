    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I've always been fine with the old saying, "rules are meant to be broken,"
      especially culinary rules, as long as the final results come out just as
      good, if not better. Unfortunately, not everyone's as liberal as I am when
      it comes to such deviations, with "real" barbecue pitmasters being a
      perfect example. To them, the idea of baking a rack of ribs, cutting it
      up, and then grilling each rib glazed with a sticky sauce is nothing short
      of sacrilege.

    <p>
      Well, that's too bad for them, since these "Easy Grilled Sticky Ribs,"
      were easy, relatively fast, and incredibly delicious. Or, as I would
      describe to them in the words of that great American philosopher, Homer
      Simpson, "sacrilicious." Don't get me wrong, as do I love a classically
      prepared, low-and-slow, smoked rack of ribs, but what I've never
      understood is having to choose between the two. Can't we have both,
      depending on our mood, and schedule?
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, to make it up to them a little bit, I respectfully called these,
      "Grilled Sticky Ribs," and not, "barbecued ribs," although I'm pretty sure
      that's what most people will refer to them as, which is fine by me.
      Semantic gymnastics aside, these ribs are a proven crowd-pleaser, and no
      matter what you call these, I really do hope you give this a try soon

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for dry rub
        together in a small bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a large sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place rack of ribs
        on the prepared pan, bone side down. Poke all over with a sharp knife.
        Make shallow slits across at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way;
        this allows the dry rub to penetrate. Coat on both sides with rub; flip
        back over, ensuring the bone side is down. Wrap tightly with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 hours.
        Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until
        cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
