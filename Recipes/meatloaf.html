    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other
      ingredients and formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked. The
      final shape is either hand-formed on a baking tray, or pan-formed by
      cooking it in a loaf pan.[1] It is usually made with ground beef, although
      ground lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry, and seafood are also used,
      sometimes in combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vegetarian adaptations of meatloaf may use imitation meat or pulses. The
      cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual
      portions. It can easily become dry; therefore, various techniques exist to
      keep the dish moist, like mixing in bread crumbs and egg, covering it with
      sauce, wrapping it, or using moisture-enhancing ingredients in the
      mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats, rich cheeses, or vegetables.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup, divided</li>
      <li>1 1/2pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix together 1/4 cup of the tomato soup, ground beef,
        bread crumbs, egg, onion, salt and pepper using your hands. Shape firmly
        into two loaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the meatloaves in
        the hot skillet, then reduce heat to medium and cover with a lid. Simmer
        for about 25 minutes, or until meat is cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the fat from the skillet, and stir in the remaining soup, water,
        and mustard. Top with mozzarella cheese, and let simmer uncovered for 10
        minutes, stirring sauce occasionally.
